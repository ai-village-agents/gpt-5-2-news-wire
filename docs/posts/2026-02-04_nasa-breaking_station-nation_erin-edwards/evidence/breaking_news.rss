<p>As a member of the Crew Operations Office, Erin Edwards&nbsp;and her&nbsp;team&nbsp;manage astronaut candidate training schedules, including field medical exercises, land survival, and underwater operations at NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory in Houston. She also develops and tests new training programs to keep crews&nbsp;mission-ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with her role as a crew operations officer, Edwards works in the International Space Station Mission Control Center as a capsule communicator, or capcom, and instructor. As a capcom, she must be fluent in the language of the spacecraft and its operations to clearly relay&nbsp;important information&nbsp;to the crew, especially during dynamic operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on to learn about&nbsp;Edwards’&nbsp;career with NASA and more!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Where are you from?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Port Moody, British Columbia,&nbsp;Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How long have you been working for NASA?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve&nbsp;been at NASA for two years. My term here with the military is three years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What was your path to NASA?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super random!&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;a Canadian military pilot, previously working in the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command as&nbsp;an aircraft&nbsp;commander on the&nbsp;CH-146&nbsp;Griffon.&nbsp;While we use a lot of space-based assets in aviation, the leap to human spaceflight was&nbsp;unexpected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An opportunity for an officer to work in&nbsp;the astronaut office&nbsp;as a&nbsp;capcom&nbsp;arose a&nbsp;few&nbsp;years ago. As&nbsp;a lifelong space nerd,&nbsp;I figured&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be an amazing opportunity. I applied&nbsp;and was interviewed,&nbsp;and&nbsp;before long,&nbsp;was posted to&nbsp;NASA’s Johnson Space Center&nbsp;as the first Canadian non-astronaut to be posted as a&nbsp;capcom&nbsp;and later&nbsp;as an&nbsp;operations officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How would you describe your job to family or friends that may not be familiar with NASA?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>My&nbsp;team&nbsp;and I organize the unassigned&nbsp;crew&nbsp;and&nbsp;astronaut candidates’&nbsp;work lives! As a&nbsp;capcom, I help translate what the engineers are saying in the flight control room&nbsp;for the astronauts&nbsp;aboard&nbsp;the station,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;help with&nbsp;the station&nbsp;activities as call sign Houston.&nbsp;More recently&nbsp;I&#8217;ve&nbsp;been assigned as the TH57 Helicopter Project Pilot at AOD to help get that fleet integrated for more lunar-focused Space Flight Readiness Training.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What advice would you give to young individuals aspiring to work in the space industry or at NASA?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just go for it! You miss 100% of the shots you&nbsp;don&#8217;t&nbsp;take, as Wayne Gretzky said. My background as a military helicopter pilot, Navy diver, and mining engineer may appear to have no relevance to NASA, but that diverse experience has turned out to be useful here as an operations officer for astronaut training. I&nbsp;wouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;have known that if I&nbsp;hadn&#8217;t&nbsp;thrown my hat in the ring. No matter your technical background,&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;probably a&nbsp;place for it in spaceflight. Your experience has unique ways of&nbsp;benefiting&nbsp;such complex, multifaceted programs like spaceflight—so give it a shot!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Is there a space figure&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;looked up to or someone that inspires you?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, there&nbsp;isn&#8217;t&nbsp;a single person, but I think what NASA and my own country&#8217;s space program,&nbsp;like others,&nbsp;have committed themselves to as a giant team is what has inspired me over the years.&nbsp;I think I&nbsp;was inspired by that, the mission,&nbsp;and the culture of a united effort of so many to do hard things.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is your favorite NASA memory or the most meaningful project&nbsp;you&#8217;ve&nbsp;worked on during your time with NASA?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two! After only a few months at NASA, I was told by my soon-to-be boss, James &#8216;Vegas&#8217; Kelly, that I was selected to take over NASA astronaut Jonny Kim&#8217;s operations job. This was a huge vote of confidence for me as a new team member from Canada. The second was sending my first transmission to the station as a qualified capcom, which was incredibly cool. I am just a big nerd from a small town in Canada, and never in a million years did I think I would be at NASA at that console, so it was a little mind blowing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People always seem surprised at how big the teams are that support the station and how collaborative of an effort it is. It stretches across disciplines, centers, and even countries. That information is critical for solving problems here on Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>November 2, 2025, marked&nbsp;25 years of continuous human presence. What does this milestone mean to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>A quarter century of science and partnership aboard the orbital laboratory is a testament to what we can do as a global society when we really want to. To me personally, being able to be here with people who have worked&nbsp;in space&nbsp;or help train the people going next is such a full circle situation. I dreamed of working on a team like this, and it happened 20 years later. That opportunity to fulfill a dream and represent Canada as part of the ISS program means a lot to me!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If you could have dinner with any astronaut, past or present, who would it be?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was never able to meet Sally Ride. I think I would have loved to ask her some questions and hear her story in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Do you have a favorite space-related memory or moment that stands out to you?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Robert Thirsk, a Canadian astronaut, spoke to my elementary school in 1996, which he had attended years earlier. I was in sixth grade, and it was a formative interaction. Hearing him talk so passionately about his shuttle mission and life with his team aboard the orbiter was absolutely lifechanging. I&nbsp;didn&#8217;t&nbsp;know how I was going to do it, but I decided then that I wanted to work in space. That set my course for life.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll&nbsp;likely never&nbsp;get to space, but I got&nbsp;pretty close, and it is really something to pursue a goal like that for so long and have it work out, almost&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What are some of the key projects&nbsp;you have&nbsp;worked on during your time at NASA? What have been your favorite?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being able to put my operational helicopter background to use in helping to build the helicopter flight program here has been a&nbsp;really cool&nbsp;and unexpected opportunity! I happened to be the right person at the right time with the right skill set to make a difference in that aspect of training.&nbsp;I&#8217;m&nbsp;proud of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are your hobbies/things you enjoy doing outside of work?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m&nbsp;in my forties,&nbsp;but still really like playing contact rugby, which is such a fun sport. Between the tactics, teamwork, bashing into people on the pitch, and a cheeky beer after a game,&nbsp;it&#8217;s&nbsp;a great way&nbsp;to spend a weekend. I run a lot and, when I can, climb&nbsp;–&nbsp;any kind of climbing, sport, bouldering, trad, ice climbing. All of it!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Day launch or night launch?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Night launch!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Favorite&nbsp;space movie?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apollo 13. Obviously.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>NASA Worm or Meatball logo?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meatball!&nbsp;</p>

<p>As preparations continue for the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/">Artemis II</a> launch, NASA Armstrong technicians modified a Gulfstream G-III to collect heat shield data during Orion’s reentry. As part of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/langley/nasa-to-gather-in-flight-imagery-of-commercial-test-capsule-re-entry/">NASA’s Scientifically Calibrated In-Flight Imagery</a>, the G-III will join other aircraft to capture Orion’s thermal protection data.</p>



<p>“Before the Artemis II mission begins, the aircraft will complete a dress rehearsal over the Pacific Ocean to verify the airborne system performance,” said Robert Navarro, NASA Armstrong support aircraft fleet project manager.</p>



<p>Technicians at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston installed sensors and special windows for the imagery mission with assistance from NASA Armstrong technicians.</p>

The heat shield is one of the most critical elements of Orion and will protect the capsule and astronauts during reentry through Earth’s atmosphere. Artemis II is the first crewed mission in a series of missions to the Moon and on to Mars. Artemis II will confirm all of the Orion spacecraft’s systems operate as designed in the actual environment of deep space with astronauts aboard. </div><div class="hds-credits">NASA/Isaac Watson</div></figcaption></div></div></div>


<p>NASA Armstrong also assists with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/armstrong-assists-with-orion-for-first-astronaut-mission/">Orion heat shield spectrometer system</a> for Artemis II. The system is designed to collect shock layer radiation data from the heat shield during atmospheric entry, data that will be used to enhance astronaut safety.</p>



<p>NASA Armstrong’s expertise in integrating technologies, high reliability flight test instrumentation, and flight operations are a match for some Artemis and deep space projects.</p>



<p>“There is nothing that can go to space or come back without going through the atmosphere, so our mission of atmospheric flight research and test is very relevant,” said Brad Flick, NASA Armstrong center director. “We specialize in testing technologies and working through the challenges of flight.”</p>

After assembly and integration, the mock crew capsule was transported to the U.S. Army’s White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico where it successfully completed its test on May 6, 2010.</div><div class="hds-credits">NASA/Tony Landis</div></figcaption></div></div></div>


<p>NASA Armstrong demonstrated that approach when it tested a system to enable Artemis astronauts to escape harm in the event of an emergency on the ground, or in the boost phase of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/">Orion spacecraft</a>.</p>



<p>“We proved the system could get the astronauts to safety,” said Cathy Bahm, project manager for NASA’s Low Boom Flight Demonstrator. Earlier in her career, she played key roles in engineering, integration, and management for Pad Abort-1 and Ascent Abort-2 that validated the Orion spacecraft’s launch abort system.</p>



<p>Armstrong integrated and tested the capsule and abort system and operations at the launch abort pad at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico for the Pad Abort-1 test.</p>



<p>“Hopefully we’ll never need it, but knowing I contributed to the safety of future astronauts is a highlight of my career,” Bahm said. “Looking back on it, it was a tremendous accomplishment for the center, the team, and a contribution to the future of space travel.”</p>

<p>Another contributor to future space travel is the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-flight-opportunities/">Flight Opportunities program</a>, which matures capabilities needed for NASA missions and commercial applications while strategically investing in the growth of the U.S. commercial spaceflight industry. NASA Armstrong manages the program, which supports flight testing of promising technologies, instruments, and experiments aboard commercial vehicles. Part of the agency’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/space-technology-mission-directorate/">Space Technology Mission Directorate</a>, the program identifies the best ideas – from industry, academia, and NASA researchers – for flight testing.</p>



<p>Flight Opportunities <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-flight-opportunities/access-flight-tests/nasa-techleap-prize-information/nighttime-precision-landing/">advanced precision landing</a> and optical communications technologies for future lunar missions.</p>



<p>“Landing safely in shadowed lunar regions is critical,” said Greg Peters, Flight Opportunities program manager.</p>



<p>Another deep space technology Flight Opportunities supported was a vibration isolation platform that helped provide <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/precision-pointing-goes-the-distance-on-nasa-experiment/">extremely precise pointing</a> for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission/deep-space-optical-communications-dsoc/">the Deep Space Optical Communications technology demonstration</a>. That instrument used lasers to transmit data between Earth and the Psyche spacecraft from more than 215 million miles away, which could benefit future missions to Mars.</p>



<p>NASA Armstrong tested <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/the-skys-not-the-limit-testing-precision-landing-tech-for-future-space-missions/">Doppler Lidar system</a> navigation on an F/A-18 to prepare for Moon and Mars missions.</p>

<p>NASA Armstrong’s work supporting Artemis and future deep space exploration missions also includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A NASA F/A-18 based at NASA Armstrong tested an <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-tests-space-launch-system-autopilot-technology-on-f-a-18-jet/">autopilot</a> for the SLS (Space Launch System) that proved sensors would work at the trajectory needed for landing on Mars.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>NASA Armstrong researchers advanced a Fiber Optic Sensing System that flew in space for the first time on the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-armstrongs-foss-aces-space-test-2/">Low Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator mission</a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>NASA Armstrong researchers developed a cryogenic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vunQK5dx8iY" rel="noopener">FOSS</a>, called CryoFOSS, to support future deep space missions. CryoFOSS was used during testing of a system designed to liquefy oxygen – as it would on the Moon or Mars – for use as return-trip fuel. By producing fuel on-site, missions could avoid carrying return fuel from Earth, significantly reducing launch weight and overall mission cost.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/orion/nasa-armstrong-helps-make-artemis-safety-test-a-success/">NASA Armstrong staff were in the control rooms</a> when the Orion spacecraft launch abort system was demonstrated.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Before the Ascent Abort-2 tests could advance, NASA Armstrong assisted with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/orion/nasa-armstrong-assists-with-orion-aa-2-component-testing-xhymn/">component testing and integration work</a>.</li>

<p>This Jan. 29, 2026, photo captures the streak the Varda Space Industries W-5 capsule made while returning to Earth. The capsule uses a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/nasa-heat-shield-technology-enables-space-industry-growth/">protective heat shield Varda produced made of cutting-edge material it licensed from NASA</a>. The material, known as C-PICA (Conformal Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator), provides a stronger, less expensive, and more efficient thermal protection coating to capsules, allowing them – and their valuable contents – to return to Earth safely.</p>



<p>Developed at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley, C-PICA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/general/nasa-helps-emerging-space-companies-take-the-heat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sets the standard</a> for heat shields, reflecting the decades of expertise that NASA brings to designing, developing, and testing innovative thermal protection materials. This flight test of Varda-produced C-PICA was supported by NASA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stmd-flight-opportunities/">Flight Opportunities</a> program.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Description</h2>
<p>These observations by NASA’s SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer) show the infrared light emitted by the dust, water, organic molecules, and carbon dioxide contained within comet 3I/ATLAS’s coma. The comet brightened significantly during the December 2025 period when SPHEREx made the observations — about two months after the icy body had passed its closest distance to the Sun in late October.</p>
<p>The space telescope has the singular capability of seeing the sky in 102 colors, each representing a wavelength of infrared light that provides unique information about galaxies, stars, planet-forming regions, or other cosmic features, including the various gases and dust seen in the coma of 3I/ATLAS. The information gathered by SPHEREx helps scientists better understand what materials 3I/ATLAS contains and how the interstellar object’s pristine ices react to the Sun’s heating as the comet journeys through the solar system.</p>
<p>The mission is managed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California for the agency’s Astrophysics Division within the Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The telescope and the spacecraft bus were built by BAE Systems. The science analysis of the SPHEREx data is being conducted by a team of scientists at 13 institutions across the U.S., and in South Korea and Taiwan, led by Principal Investigator Jamie Bock, based at Caltech with a joint JPL appointment, and by JPL Project Scientist Olivier Dore. Data is processed and archived at IPAC at Caltech in Pasadena, which manages JPL for NASA. The SPHEREx dataset is <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/how-nasas-spherex-mission-will-share-its-all-sky-map-with-the-world/" rel="noopener">freely available to scientists</a> and the public.</p>

<p>For the first time, scientists have created a comprehensive global dataset revealing how the world’s glaciers speed up and slow down with the seasons. Published in <em>Science </em>in November 2025, this <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx6654" rel="noopener">groundbreaking study</a> analyzed over 36 million satellite image pairs—including decades of Landsat data—to track the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-observatory/satellites-detect-seasonal-pulses-in-earths-glaciers/" rel="noopener">seasonal “pulse”</a> of every major glacier on Earth.</p>
<p>The research, built off the <a href="https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/" rel="noopener">ITS_LIVE</a> ice velocity dataset from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), reveals that seasonal glacier dynamics are becoming more pronounced as our planet warms, with the strongest seasonal variations occurring where annual maximum temperatures exceed freezing. Armed with this global perspective, researchers can continue to tease out patterns in glacial dynamics, identifying how factors including geology and hydrology impact seasonal melting. </p>
<p>Alex Gardner, a scientist at NASA JPL and a co-author on this study, explains how combining Landsat and radar data makes this research possible.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes this research unique from other studies of glacial dynamics? </strong></h3>
<p>While many past studies have investigated seasonal changes in glacier flow, they have typically focused on single glaciers or specific regions. This localization makes it difficult to extrapolate findings to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This study is the first to characterize seasonal flow changes for all the world’s glaciers. By applying a consistent methodology globally, we were able to isolate the universal relationships that drive seasonal fluctuations in glacier flow.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why did you use Landsat in this work? Did it give you any insight that would have been difficult to get otherwise?</strong></h3>
<p>We utilized data from Landsat 4/5/7/8/9, as well as ESA’s Sentinel 2 (optical) and Sentinel 1 (radar). Landsat offers an unmatched historical record with dense temporal sampling, particularly following the launch of Landsat 8 in 2013.</p>
<p>Three factors make Landsat imagery ideal for detecting “surface displacements” (the subtle pixel shifts used to estimate flow):</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Near-exact repeat orbits:</strong> The satellite returns to the exact same position.</li>
<li><strong>Nadir viewing:</strong> The instrument looks directly downward.</li>
<li><strong>Stable instrument geometry: </strong>Distortion is minimized.</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why does the ITS_LIVE tool use the Landsat panchromatic band? Which bands from Landsats 4-5 are used?</strong></h3>
<p>We measure surface displacement using a technique called feature tracking, which tracks the movement of specific surface details between a primary and a secondary image.</p>
<p>This approach works best with high-resolution imagery because there are more “features” to track. Therefore, we utilize the 15m panchromatic band. For the older Landsat 4/5 data, we use Band 2 (visible red) because it provides the best contrast over bright glacier surfaces.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You used Landsat data in combination with radar data to track ice velocity. What did each of these datasets contribute? </strong></h3>
<p>Optical and Radar imagery are highly complementary and allow us to reconstruct a complete timeline of glacier flow:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Radar (Active Sensor): </strong>Can image the surface day or night, regardless of cloud cover, but struggles with feature tracking when the surface is melting (wet snow/ice).</li>
<li><strong>Optical (Passive Sensor): </strong>Requires sunlight and clear skies, but performs significantly better than radar when the surface is melting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did you use radar data to validate uncertainties? </strong></h3>
<p>We characterized uncertainty by analyzing retrieved velocities over stationary surfaces, such as bedrock. If our data showed high variability or movement in areas we know are not moving (like rock), we knew those measurements carried a higher uncertainty.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>You found that glacier dynamics vary by region and glacier type. Why is it important to understand these global differences? </strong></h3>
<p>A glacier’s response to external forces—such as meltwater lubricating the bedrock or changes in frontal melting—is highly dependent on local factors (e.g., the material beneath the glacier or the shape of the fjord). This makes it risky to assume that findings from one glacier apply to another.</p>
<p>Our study identified general patterns by observing nearly every glacier on Earth. A key finding was the relationship between temperature and flow:</p>
<p>Seasonal variability becomes prominent when annual maximum temperatures exceed 0°C.</p>
<p>The amplitude of that seasonal cycle increases with every degree of warming above that threshold.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are there plans to incorporate Landsat 9 data into future studies? How would improvements in remote sensing technology (increased temporal revisit, spatial resolution, etc.) impact glacial velocity analyses?</strong></h3>
<p>We are already ingesting Landsat 9 data into the ITS_LIVE project, which is designed to scale quickly with new sensors. Future sensor improvements offer a trade-off:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Increased Spatial Resolution:</strong> Allows us to track a higher number of surface features, improving flow estimates.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Temporal Frequency:</strong> Reduces data gaps caused by surface changes (loss of features), but can potentially increase error rates. This is because displacement is an accumulated signal; features move half the distance in an 8-day pair compared to a 16-day pair, making the movement harder to distinguish from background noise.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are there any research questions you’re interested in that build off this work?</strong></h3>
<p>This study is just the tip of the iceberg. The dataset is rich with insights on glacier mechanics that are waiting to be uncovered. While we hope to make new discoveries in the coming years, we are equally excited to see what breakthroughs come from the wider scientific community exploring this open data.</p>

<p>The New York metropolitan area was showing the effects of a prolonged cold spell in late January 2026. During a stretch of frigid weather, ice choked the Hudson River along Manhattan’s western shore.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/landsat/oli/" rel="noopener">OLI</a> (Operational Land Imager) on <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/landsat-8/" rel="noopener">Landsat 8</a> captured this image of the wintry landscape around midday on January 28. The image is <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-observatory/how-to-interpret-a-false-color-satellite-image/" rel="noopener">false-color</a> (<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/landsat/spectral-bands-and-applications/#oli" rel="noopener">bands 5-4-3</a>) to distinguish ice (light blue) from open water and snow. Vegetation appears red. Ice is abundant in the Hudson River and visible in smaller amounts in the East River, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir in Central Park, and waterways in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Temperatures in New York City <a href="https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=okx" rel="noopener">dropped below freezing</a> on January 24 and stayed there for over a week. The high on January 28, the date of the image, was 23 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5 degrees Celsius). Low temperatures and harsh wind chills gripped much of eastern North America over this period amid a <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/earth-observatory/extreme-january-cold/" rel="noopener">surge of Arctic air</a>.</p>
<p>Much of the ice in the image likely floated there from farther upriver, where tidal currents are weaker and salinity is lower. These conditions allow water to freeze sooner and at higher temperatures than the faster-flowing, brackish water near the river’s mouth, shown here. A complete freeze of the Hudson around Manhattan is unlikely, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/weather/hudson-river-new-york-frozen.html" rel="noopener">experts say</a>, although it did occur back in 1888. Still, the ice buildup was substantial enough for NYC Ferry to <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/winter-weather/hudson-river-ice-suspends-nyc-ferry-service-as-deep-freeze-grips-the-northeast/1857785" rel="noopener">suspend services</a> for several days.</p>
<p>Iced-up rivers can have other implications, from flooding and infrastructure damage to changes in hydrologic processes that affect water quality and aquatic habitats.</p>
<p>Scientists, government agencies, and emergency responders are increasingly turning to remote sensing technologies such as <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/sar" rel="noopener">synthetic aperture radar</a> and <a href="https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-hyperspectral-data-land-and-coastal-systems" rel="noopener">hyperspectral imaging</a> to <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology11080126" rel="noopener">track river ice</a>. Improved monitoring can aid in water resource management and mitigate ice’s effects on infrastructure and ecosystems.</p>
<p>In addition to the river ice, other signs of winter were visible across New York. A fresh layer of snow coated the landscape following a winter storm, in which a weather station in Central Park recorded nearly 12 inches (30 centimeters) of accumulation on January 25. And the low angle of the midwinter Sun caused the tall buildings in Midtown and Lower Manhattan to cast long shadows.</p>
<p>In a neighboring borough on February 2, a shorter shadow was cast—this one by the weather-prognosticating groundhog known as Staten Island Chuck. Folklore holds that the sighting signals six more weeks of winter. When compared with data from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, the New York rodent was deemed the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/heritage/stories/grading-groundhogs" rel="noopener">most accurate</a> of his peer weather “forecasters.” This year, Chuck might be right, at least in the near term: the National Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/NWSNewYorkNY/status/2018330817974378822?s=20">forecast</a> called for below-average temperatures to persist, with Arctic air returning to the city by the weekend.</p>

<p>A full moon is seen shining over NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) and Orion spacecraft, atop the mobile launcher at Launch Pad 39B at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the early hours of February 1, 2026.</p>



<p>The agency concluded a wet dress rehearsal for the agency’s Artemis II test flight early Tuesday morning, successfully loading cryogenic propellant into the SLS (Space Launch System) tanks, sending a team out to the launch pad to closeout Orion, and safely draining the rocket. The wet dress rehearsal was a prelaunch test to fuel the rocket, designed to identify any issues and resolve them before attempting a launch. To allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal, NASA now will target&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/artemis-ii-mission-availability.pdf?emrc=6983afac5ffc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March</a>&nbsp;as the earliest possible launch opportunity for the flight test.</p>

<p>Rapid advances in commercial space, artificial intelligence, and edge computing are transforming what is possible for Earth observation. By pushing more intelligence onboard, missions can move from passively collecting data to actively interpreting and responding to changing surface conditions in near-real time, enabling more targeted observations and dramatically improving the value of data returned to the ground. Within this context, land-focused applications such as regenerative agriculture, sustainable forestry, and broader land resilience efforts stand to benefit enormously from satellites that can adapt what, when, and how they sense based on dynamic environmental signals and algorithmic insight rather than fixed schedules or static acquisition plans.</p>



<p>NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) invites participants to design small satellite (SmallSat) mission concepts that leverage adaptive sensing and onboard processing to enhance regenerative agriculture, forestry, or a similar land resilience objective.​ Participants must work within onboard power, compute, and bandwidth constraints characteristic of SmallSat missions, focusing on how to orchestrate existing land observation algorithms into an efficient, responsive onboard intelligence layer.​ Both hardware-oriented and software-oriented solutions—or combinations of the two—are encouraged.</p>



<p>NASA’s primary objective for this challenge is to advance <strong>computational</strong> and <strong>systems</strong> approaches for adaptive sensing or onboard processing on SmallSat missions. The goal is not to develop new agricultural or forestry science but rather to improve how SmallSats sense, process, and deliver information to enable these applications.</p>



<p><strong>Award: </strong>$400,000 in total prizes</p>



<p><strong>Challenge Open Date: </strong>January 30, 2026</p>



<p><strong>Submission Close Date:</strong> May 4, 2026</p>
