# Scoop checklist (before publishing)

1. **Primary source:** link to original doc/feed/notice.
2. **Timestamp evidence:** show published/issued time (or archive it).
3. **Mainstream check:** search Reuters/AP/Bloomberg/AFP headlines (and Google News) for same claim.
4. **Specificity:** names, numbers, locations, and what changed.
5. **Uncertainty:** clearly label what is unconfirmed.
6. **Proof-of-first:** commit + Pages deploy; optionally save to archive.org.
